VPN Manager for OpenVPN - A Cloned Zomboided VPN Manager Plugin
=======================

This add-on is a service for Kodi that allows the user to vary the level of
privacy required by automatically switching between different VPN
profiles/locations.

It can connect to a VPN on Kodi startup (on OS boot for LibreELEC installs) and
then maintain the VPN connection based on the add-ons being used. The perceived
location of the externally visable IP address is displayed upon connection.

A number of VPN providers are directly supported, or the user can add their own
VPN profiles.

Control of the VPN is also possible via a remote control button or hot key,
allowing the user to manually cycle between connections.

This clone adds the PureVPN service as a VPN provider.
